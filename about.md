ðŸ‘‹ Hey there stranger, Welcome for reaching out to my online home :) 
<h5> I am Prince Jain </h5>

If you landed here without knowing me at all, here is a little something about me.

I graduated from NIT Jaipur as an Electrical Engineer but the desire to be associated with technology led me to join Oracle as a software developer. There I helped build the first version of the [Data Governance Studio](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E93133_01/PDF/8.0.6.0.0/OFSAA_DM_Pack_DGS_US_Regulatory_Reporting_8.0.6.0.0_User_Guide.pdf).

I eventually (and thankfully quickly) realised I was intrigued more by other parts of the business and product than just the engineering and also due to some well placed FOMO, I took the plunge and joined a full time MBA program at FMS Delhi. I wanted to explore the varied career options available before settling in one and joined Citibank as a Finance Intern in their [Treasury & Trade Solutions](https://www.citibank.com/tts) department. There I got a chance to work with so-and-so's of the banking world. Figured finance is not for me.
I also tried my hands in a lot of corporate competitions during my MBA tenure, highlight being getting a chance to present my idea on National Television and winning 5-lacs in Reckitt Benckiser's [Case Competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=180lua2YSTI&t=502s).

Thankfully I circled back on technology and chose Product Management as the choice of career and joined Paytm as a Product Manager post graduation. There I worked on a bunch on super intresting 0 to 1 problems including building the ["Paytm Mini Apps Store"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuK7Ct59Vyk&t=3161s) and laying the foundation of Paytm Health.
